# Hey there!

Some info about me:

- I'm a fresh high school graduate
- I've been coding since 2011 or so (although I became more serious about that a few years ago).
- Since the beginning of 2021 my main point of interest is PHP + Symfony framework, but I'm proficient in other languages too (mainly Python and JS/TS).
