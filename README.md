# Hello!

I'm a 19 years old developer based in Poland.

I currently work on an [open-source danmaku (bullet hell) game](//github.com/karmek-k/dandash).
Besides that, I also do backend, and sometimes frontend development.

### [Check out my blog!](https://karmek-k-blog.netlify.app/)

## More about me

- Started out programming with C++ in 2011
- Cat lover
- Sometimes makes some music (guitar)
- Performs really well at googling (but uses DuckDuckGo :D)

### Preferred frameworks

- backend: Express.js / Django / Symfony
- frontend: React
- game: libGDX (I'm not used to game dev, but this one is pretty comfy)
