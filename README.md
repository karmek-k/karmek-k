# Hey there!

Some info about me:

- I'm a fresh high school graduate
- I've been coding since 2011 or so (although I became more serious about that a few years ago).
- I started exploring PHP + Symfony framework at the beginning of 2021, but I'm proficient in other languages too (mainly Python and JS/TS).
