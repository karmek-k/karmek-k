# Hello!

I'm a 19 years old developer based in Poland.

I usually do backend, and sometimes frontend development.

## Featured projects

#### Finished

- [TinyReader](https://github.com/karmek-k/tinyreader) - A simple self-hosted RSS reader written in Symfony. Supports automatic article reloading, multiple users and includes an admin panel.

- [Remind Me](https://github.com/karmek-k/remind-me) - A web service that allows for reminding/notifying users via various channels (currently only Discord is supported). Users can create *reminders* that are triggerred by *reminder jobs* - scheduled jobs that start every day, at a designated hour and minute.
As for now, the GraphQL API is complete and I'm working on the Next.js frontend, feel free to set up an environment with `docker-compose` and introspect the API with a GraphQL client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)!

  * Frontend - *TypeScript, Next.js, Material-UI*
- [Friendly Notes](https://github.com/karmek-k/friendly-notes) - A pastebin that supports syntax highlighting. Has an English and Polish translation. Also, it allows users to fetch a random paste and has a Django admin panel.
